    <h1>First Day Coding</h1>
    <p>
        <p>I am excited to share that I recently completed a project that involved creating a DM response check function in my role as a software engineer. This function detects new responses to DMs, stores them in an SQLite database, and reports them to the user.</p>
<p>The task was challenging, but I was able to complete it successfully by leveraging my coding skills and experience. I created a function that works for DMs and detects new responses after a few days. If a person responds, the function reports the new responses again. The function also stores the messages in an SQLite database, which makes it easy to review and analyze the data.</p>
<p>To implement this functionality, I used Python and Selenium, a web testing framework. The code includes a loop that checks for new DM responses and stores the message content, reaction types, and link in a CSV file. The function is also able to detect DMs that have already been checked, which makes the process more efficient.</p>
<p>I am proud of this accomplishment and feel that it showcases my skills as a software engineer. By successfully implementing this function, I was able to demonstrate my ability to work with complex code and solve problems. I am excited to continue to develop my skills in this area and tackle new challenges in the future.</p>
<p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience, and I am excited to share my success with my network. I encourage other software engineers to take on challenges and push their limits, as this is the best way to grow and improve your skills. #coding #softwareengineer #testing #python #learning #software #project</p>
