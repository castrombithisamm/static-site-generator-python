I am excited to share that I recently completed a project that involved creating a DM response check function in my role as a software engineer. This function detects new responses to DMs, stores them in an SQLite database, and reports them to the user.

The task was challenging, but I was able to complete it successfully by leveraging my coding skills and experience. I created a function that works for DMs and detects new responses after a few days. If a person responds, the function reports the new responses again. The function also stores the messages in an SQLite database, which makes it easy to review and analyze the data.

To implement this functionality, I used Python and Selenium, a web testing framework. The code includes a loop that checks for new DM responses and stores the message content, reaction types, and link in a CSV file. The function is also able to detect DMs that have already been checked, which makes the process more efficient.

I am proud of this accomplishment and feel that it showcases my skills as a software engineer. By successfully implementing this function, I was able to demonstrate my ability to work with complex code and solve problems. I am excited to continue to develop my skills in this area and tackle new challenges in the future.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience, and I am excited to share my success with my network. I encourage other software engineers to take on challenges and push their limits, as this is the best way to grow and improve your skills. #coding #softwareengineer #testing #python #learning #software #project
